We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and Mac OS), many programmers use `Emacs` or `Vim` (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as `Gedit`.

The second part of such a name is called the *filename extension*, and indicates what type of data the file holds: `.txt` signals a plain text file, `.pdf` indicates a PDF document, `.cfg` is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, `.png` is a PNG image, and so on.\n",

    "When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the molecules directory (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design."
